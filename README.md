# EMATS: Event Management and Attendance Tracking System using QR Codes

An intuitive and user-friendly tool for event management and attendance tracking. The system relies on Google Forms and ZXing QR Code Scanner for scanning QR codes. When the participants register for an event using the Google forms, the Google app script associated with the forms, sends out a QR code to the registered email address. The participant then presents this QR code at the event venue to gain entry (upon validation of the code). Additionally, the mobile app also shows pie charts with participant demographics, food requirements etc.


# Pre- Requisites and Dependencies
The following software tools are required to execute the EMATS:
- Android smartphone with [ZXing QR Code Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&hl=en) for reading the QR codes
- [MIT App Inventor 2](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/)
- Google Drive account to setup GForms and a linked spreadsheet to log the responses
- A stable internet connection as the data will be validated using the spreadsheet which is also updated iteratively
